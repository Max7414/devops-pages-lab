# Deployment and Automation Checklist

## 1. Prepare Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private as required by your course).
2. Push the contents of this folder to the new repository.

```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-pages-lab.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: GitHub Pages automation scaffold"
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Configure the `TOKEN` Secret

1. Generate a Personal Access Token (classic) at <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>.
2. Select scope:
   - `public_repo` (public activity only) **or**
   - `repo` (to include private activity).
3. Copy the token once generated.
4. In the repository, go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
5. Name the secret `TOKEN` and paste the PAT value.

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Navigate to Settings → Pages.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch.
   - **Branch:** `main`.
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`.
3. Save. GitHub will display the live URL once the first build completes.

## 4. Trigger the Activity Workflow

1. Go to the Actions tab.
2. Select **Update Activity Log**.
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**.
4. Verify the run succeeded and updated `README.md` (check commits tab or workflow summary).

## 5. Verify the Site

1. Visit the Pages URL (e.g., `https://USERNAME.github.io/devops-pages-lab/`).
2. Confirm the homepage mirrors `README.md` with updated activity.
3. Capture screenshots for your report.

## 6. Collect Deliverables

- Live site URL.
- Repository URL.
- Screenshot of homepage showcasing the activity log.
- Link to workflow run that updated `README.md`.
- Commit link generated by the workflow.
- Completed PDF report (6–10 pages) exported from `report-template.md`.
