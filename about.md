# About This Lab

Welcome! This site documents the DevOps GitHub Pages lab completed by **Max7414**.

- **Course:** DevOps (2025)
- **Focus:** Automating personal GitHub activity into a live Pages site
- **Stack:** GitHub Actions, Jekyll (default), Personal Access Token

## Highlights

1. **Continuous Activity Feed** — A scheduled workflow refreshes the README activity block every weekday at 12:00 UTC.
2. **Single Source of Truth** — `index.md` includes `README.md`, so project documentation and the homepage stay perfectly in sync.
3. **Custom Styling** — A lightweight CSS bundle under `assets/css/custom.css` adds brand colors and layout polish.
